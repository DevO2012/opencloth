This page is higlighting the new changes that will be done in the code base.


= Details =
  * I will be doing a basic self collision demo soon using the Provot seminal paper (http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-02-winter/Papers/Collisions_vetements.pdf) as a start. 
  * Since collision detection requires a lot of neighbor search, I will be adding support for collision structures like spatial hashing and KdTrees to reduce the neighbor search.
  * Once these are ready, we will see how to add suport for more current state-of-the-art self collision methods for cloth self collision.
