This page is higlighting some recent changes that have been done in the code base.


= Details =
  * Currently I am busy working on my thesis. As soon as I am done with it, I will update the repository with more stuff like handling of polygonal meshes, skeletal animation and accelerating collision detections etc.
  * ~~Include a demo implementing Meshless FEM based on the wonderful paper Point based animation of elastic, plastic and melting objects by Matthias Muller et. al and the chapter Meshless FEM in the book Point based graphics.~~
  * ~~Included a demo showing how to do basic texture mapping on cloth as well as how to calculate the normals for lighting.~~
  * ~~Included the simplest possible implicitly integrated implementation of Co-rotated Linear FEM with Stiffness Warping.~~ 
  * ~~Collision detection with simple ellipsoid~~
